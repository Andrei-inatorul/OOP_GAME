## About
This project was as an optional assignment for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class, and it turned out to be a fun experience that help me apply theoretical concepts in a practical context.
## Short Game Description
In this game you play as a mysterious yet cute hooded figure that explores a dark forest in search of his  lost companion.
The game is a platformer where the player must avoid obstacles, jumping from platform to platform. It is in a very early stage, consisting in only 3 levels, but i may continue working on it as a passion project after the exams.
## Game Mechanics
Here is a table of mechanics included in the game.
| Mechanic | Short description |
| :----------------: | :----------------: |
|   Double Jumping     |   The player can jump once, then jump again in mid air for added mobility.   |
|   Passable Platforms     |   Platforms that the player can pass through from below, allowing for unique level design.     |
| Camera Follows Player | The in-game camera dynamically tracks the player's movements, making his life harder sometimes ðŸ˜ˆ |
| Spikes with reset | Hazardous spikes that, when touched, reset the player to the starting position. |
| Game data saving| The game saves the current level and gives the player the ability to continue where he left off or start a new game from the main menu|
|Animations| Beautiful animations to bring life to the player character|
